## Micro View
**Note :** A task group is a group of tasks that should be started asynchronously (meaning in the same time), unless the start date indicates otherwise.<br> 
For example all tasks in the task group 1 should start at the same time, with the exception of the second task that should start after the first task is finished, because the first task is a dependency for the second task.
Task Group | Task ID | Element | Description | Start Date | End Date | NÂ° Of Days | Status
